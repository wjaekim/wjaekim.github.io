  content: "<a href='https://www.nsf.gov/'>NSF</a> has awarded a research grant ($299,794) to support Dr. Kim's
  project titled <em>Toward a General Framework for Optimal Experimentation in Computational Cognition</em>.
  Co-funded by NSF's Methodology, Measurement, Statistics (MMS) and Perception, Action, and Cognition (PAC) programs,
  this project will perform preparatory work toward a general computational framework for optimal experimentation
  in cognitive modeling research. Its successful completion will be key to further software development and applications
  in content areas. The project envisages enabling computational cognition researchers to raise the level of complexity
  at which cognitive tasks and their quantitative accounts are developed."
