  content: "<a href='https://www.nsf.gov/'>NSF</a> has awarded a research grant ($299,794) to support Dr. Kim's
  project titled <em>Toward a General Framework for Optimal Experimentation in Computational Cognition</em>.
  Co-funded by NSF's Methodology, Measurement, Statistics (MMS) and Perception, Action, and Cognition (PAC) programs,
  this project will lay the computational foundation for optimal experimentation
  in cognitive modeling research. Its successful completion will be key to further software development and applications
  in content areas. By facilitating optimal accrual of scientific evidence, the project envisages enabling computational
  cognition researchers to raise the level of complexity at which cognitive tasks and their theoretical accounts are developed.
