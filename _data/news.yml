  headline: Dr. Kim received an exploratory research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF)
  content: "<a href='https://www.nsf.gov/'>NSF</a> awarded a grant (BCS-1834323; $299,794) to support Dr. Kim's research
  project <em>Toward a General Framework for Optimal Experimentation in Computational Cognition</em>.
  Jointly funded by NSF's <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5421'>Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics (MMS)</a>
  and <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5686'>Perception, Action, and Cognition (PAC)</a> programs,
  this project will lay the computational foundation for optimal experimentation
  in cognitive modeling research. Its successful completion will be key to subsequent software development and applications
  in substantive areas. By facilitating optimal accrual of scientific evidence, the project envisages enabling computational
  cognition researchers to raise the level of sophistication at which various mechanisms of cognition are explained."

  headline: Dr. Kim contributes to child mental health research supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
  content: "The research project, led by <a href='https://ezerkang-howard-faculty.com/'>Dr. Ezer Kang</a> at Howard University, 
  on improvig child mental health services in Nigeria has just been funded by the
  <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/'>National Institute of Mental Health</a> (R15MH117631; $325,381).
  Dr. Kim joined the project team as a Co-Investigator from its outset when the study was designed as a research proposal.
  Having contributed to the study's preliminary model building and data analysis plan, Dr. Kim will continue to provide
  his expertise in structural equation modeling and linear mixed-effects regression analysis. By investigating multiple factors
  that hinder child mental health services in Nigeria, the research intends to suggest suitable strategies for increasing
  their effective utilization."
