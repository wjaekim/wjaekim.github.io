Located in the [Department of Psychology](http://coas.howard.edu/psychology/) at [Howard University](https://www2.howard.edu/) and directed by [Dr. Woojae Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NTYc27IAAAAJ&hl=en), our research lab aims at learning the mind through quantitative modeling. Currerntly, the focus of our lab is twofold: (1) developing and empirically testing the utility of [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) algorithms, a cutting-edge information query method, in [computational modeling of cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_cognition); and (2) applying recent developments in quantitative methodology, mostly underutilized, in substative psychology research to provide convincing demonstrations. In a nutshell, we strive to learn the mind by actively querying it as well as to learn how to learn it by actively applying quantitative research methods.

We believe that quantitative modeling contributes to the progress of psychological science by providing understandings of the underlying mechanisms of behavior on the level of precision that is difficult to obtain otherwise. This contribution can be made in a number of different ways. For further information about our lab's research program, see [Research](research).
